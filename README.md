# [Groomify](https://groomify-beta.vercel.app/) - _Woof_ there ever be a better time than _meow?_

## Description: 
A Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue.js. Groomify takes a great deal of inspiration from [Helcim](https://www.helcim.com/). Through Groomify's design, copywriting, and teamwork aspect I hoped to capture and reflect Helcim's culture and values, while trying my best to maintain its own identity.

### [Live Demo](https://groomify-beta.vercel.app/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eltonbautista/)

### Technologies & Utilities used:
- Vue.js
- TypeScript
- Figma
- SCSS | HTML | JavaScript

### Highlights:
- Collaborated with a team of three to design, prototype, and build. Members: Elton Bautista (Me), [Robert Kugler](https://github.com/superbahbi), and [Edgar Caballero](https://github.com/TSEidolon)
- Designed, prototyped, and brainstormed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jO0Oxgvol0wbDJ6IFmbk7y/Groomify?node-id=0%3A1) & [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/9yeQTR5C5sgmpfcI6kwb0a/PROJECT_GROOMIFY-BIG-BRAIN-IDEAS?node-id=0%3A1)
- No CSS frameworks or component libraries have been utilised, i.e. everything has been built through our own Vue components with SCSS | HTML | JS/TS
- My favorite components would have to be my rendition of Helcim's Carousel and the dynamic "MySalon" component which can be viewed by clicking any of the "Learn More" buttons in the #Pricing container

### Shortcomings:
- Since I was leading this project I should have created better guidelines and took the time to properly setup the build and delegate tasks accordingly
- The process behind working with the other members went very smoothly with regards to version control, but there were definitely some shortcomings that I did not expect such as different formatter configurations, or different designing techniques
- I really love and enjoy working with others but this project helped me realise that there is still so much for me to learn in the areas of setting better expectations, and creating smooth collaborative efforts
- This was the first project I worked on with Vue and familiarising myself with the framework took a little bit longer than expected, but I think that I've a good grasp of it due to my experience with React. Note: Vue was really fun to use.
- This is my first time prototyping and designing extensively on Figma and admittedly even though I enjoyed the experience I am aware that I've barely scratched the surface.
- This was also my first time using SCSS but it came to me naturally due to my experience with Styled Components














## Recommended IDE Setup

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
